Wicket6 Ajax Anchor Browser History
===================================

This repo has a pair of classes that helps to use browser history and anchor links (internal links) with Apache Wicket 6.x


Browser control is based on jQuery, and can be done with HistoryAjaxBehaviour class, which uses ajax to send to wicket
the changes on the page hash; defined into class as 'token'

An anchor link, or internal link, can be also used to make changes on the browser history and captured by the previous
  ajax behaviour.

  





Based and apapted from vmontane solution, for Wicket 1.5, you could see here
